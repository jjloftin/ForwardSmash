# ForwardSmash
Javascript game. RPS style. Parody of popular match-up from the party / platform fighting game Super Smash Brothers Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube 

You play Marth
Each level you have 4 lives
Fox moves torwards you
You throw out your option
If you throw too early - you lose a life
If you throw wrong - and Fox counters you lose a life
If you lose 4 lives - you lose the battle

Increasing difficulty.

Don't get four stocked.
